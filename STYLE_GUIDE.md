# CSS Frameworks: Feature-by-Feature Notes & Migration Potential

## Feature-by-Feature Notes

### Tailwind CSS
- Works perfectly with HTMX; utility classes apply directly to server-rendered or dynamically swapped HTML.
- In React, the same Tailwind classes are used in JSX, making migration trivial—simply move class names to React components.
- **Ecosystem:** Plugins such as daisyUI and Flowbite provide rich components and themes.

### Bootstrap
- Time-tested default for fast prototyping with strong documentation and built-in JS behaviors.
- React migration is possible (react-bootstrap), but requires mapping Bootstrap classes to React components and sometimes dealing with JS integration issues.
- Styling customization is less flexible than Tailwind; many large apps look alike.

### Bulma
- Lightweight, modern, pure CSS. Flexbox-based with a “clean sheet” approach.
- React migration is smooth with react-bulma-components; consistent classes, no JS re-implementation needed.

### Material UI
- Designed specifically for React, not for server-rendered use (like HTMX), but is the best choice if React is certain.
- Offers deep theming, accessibility, and Material Design patterns natively in React.

### Other Modern Libraries (Chakra UI, Ant Design, Mantine)
- All React-first, often with their own component libraries and CSS-in-JS approaches.
- Not ideal for initial Django/HTMX usage, but great if React is the primary or future target.

# Tailwind CSS & daisyUI Architecture Proposal

## CDN-Based Integration (Recommended for Prototyping & Simplicity)

**Why:**
- Fast setup, no build pipeline required.
- Works seamlessly with Django templates and HTMX.
- Easily migratable to React (see Migration Potential Summary above).

**How:**
- Add CDN <script> tags for Tailwind and daisyUI in `biblios/base.html`.
- Use Tailwind utility classes and daisyUI components directly in your templates

**Example:**
```html
<head>
  ...
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/daisyui@latest/dist/full.js"></script>
  ...
</head>
```

## Template Usage

- All Django templates can use Tailwind and daisyUI classes.
- HTMX swaps and fragments will inherit styling automatically.

**Example:**
```html
<div class="card bg-base-100 w-96 shadow-sm">
  <figure>
    <img src="..." alt="..." />
  </figure>
  <div class="card-body">
    <h2 class="card-title">Card Title</h2>
    <p>...</p>
    <div class="card-actions justify-end">
      <button class="btn btn-primary">Buy Now</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Migration & Scalability

- **React Migration:** Tailwind and daisyUI classes are reusable in JSX, making future migration straightforward.
- **Production:** For performance, switch to local build (npm + static files) when ready.

## Summary of Steps
1. Add CDN links to base template.
2. Use Tailwind/daisyUI classes in all templates.
3. HTMX swaps work out-of-the-box.
4. For production, consider local build for optimization.
