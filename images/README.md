# Documentation Images

This folder contains all images used throughout the project’s documentation.  
Images are organized into subfolders based on the documentation section they support.

## Subfolders

- **Document_and_Page_Management/**  
  Contains screenshots and diagrams related to managing documents, pages, edits, metadata, and versioning.

- **Collection_and_Series_Management/**  
  Stores images related to managing collections, series, grouping logic, hierarchy views, and administrative workflows.

## Naming Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., `delete-page.png`, `create-collection-step1.png`).
- Keep filenames in lowercase and use hyphens or underscores consistently.
- Only store images relevant to documentation.
