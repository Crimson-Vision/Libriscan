# LibriScan Collection & Series User Guide

## Overview

LibriScan uses a hierarchical structure to organize and manage digitized library materials. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for managing Collections, Series, Documents, and Pages within the system.

## System Hierarchy

The LibriScan system is organized into the following levels:

- **Organization**: The top-level entity that contains all your collections (e.g., "Crimson Vision")
- **Collections**: Primary groupings of related Series and documents within your organization
- **Series**: Subsets within collections that group related documents by topic or category
- **Documents**: Individual digitized items that contain one or more pages
- **Pages**: Individual scanned images within a document, with extracted text and metadata
